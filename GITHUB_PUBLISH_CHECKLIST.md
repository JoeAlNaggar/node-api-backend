- [ ] Setup scripts are in correct locations

### 📋 Metadata
- [ ] `package.json` has correct project information
- [ ] Add appropriate GitHub topics/tags
- [ ] Include a proper license file
- [ ] Add contributor guidelines if needed

## ⚠️ Important Security Considerations

### 🚨 Before Publishing
1. **Review all files manually** - Use `git status` to see what will be committed
2. **Test the setup process** - Clone to a fresh directory and follow README
3. **Scan for secrets** - Use tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog`
4. **Check permissions** - Ensure no files have overly permissive permissions

### 🛡️ Recommended Additions

```bash
# Add to your repository root
touch LICENSE          # Add appropriate license
touch SECURITY.md      # Security policy and reporting
touch CONTRIBUTING.md  # Contribution guidelines
```

### 📄 Suggested License Text
Consider adding an MIT or Apache 2.0 license with appropriate disclaimers about security tool usage.

### 🔒 Security Policy Template
```markdown
# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
- Latest release only

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security vulnerabilities to [email] with:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact

## Ethical Use
This toolkit is for authorized security testing only. Users are responsible for:
- Obtaining proper permissions
- Following applicable laws
- Using tools responsibly
```

## ✅ Final Steps

1. **Create a private repository first** to test everything
2. **Do a fresh clone and setup** to verify instructions
3. **Review all committed files** one more time
4. **Make repository public** only after verification
5. **Add appropriate GitHub topics** (security, penetration-testing, etc.)

## 🚀 Ready to Publish?

Once all items are checked, your repository is ready for GitHub! 

**Remember**: You can always make the repository private initially, test everything, and then make it public once you're confident.

Good luck with your security toolkit publication! 🎯
